Towards the end of May of 2024, as my summer vacations began, I decided to take up a massive 
target for myself. I took up a personal challenge to complete the whole R.D. Sharma textbook 
before June started (and I had yet not finished NCERT). That is, within about 15 days. But hey, the title said 10 days right? 
Yeah, cuz uhm... I shamelessly did absolutely nothing for 5 days. I'll be listing down how 
each day went, and thus being setting out a basic framework of how you could achieve it too, 
but before reading further there are few things you'd want to keep in mind.

## Who should follow this article?

There are some things you might need to know before proceeding with the article, as the way I did it might not work for everybody.

1. **Do not do this 15 days before your exam.** If you follow my roadmap, try to do it earlier 
 in the year, maybe in some vacations. While my roadmap doesn't aim to be hectic, it is not designed 
 to prepare you for an exam then and there. As we acquire a lot of knowledge in a short 
 period of time, and constantly learn concepts, this would just be a high quality starting point
 for you, so that next time you revise mathematics and attempt problems, you could find 
 resemblances and hence solve the problems faster. But if you plan to finish only this book for
 the first time before situations like examinations, you might wanna avoid doing this. Before 
 examinations, it's best to revise what you have already solved before.
2. **Try to complete the concepts beforehand.** RD Sharma consists of a huge number of problems,
 both in their examples and exercises. So majority of our time would go into solving exercises.
 Therefore, if you study the concepts beforehand, and know what the fundamental contents of the 
 chapter are, this gives you a perfect base to comfortably follow this routine. You could do 
 the concepts from NCERT or follow your preferred materials/videos. However, you could still 
 catch up with the concepts by reading RD Sharma. That would take you about another 4-5 days at 
 most, considering you are new to trigonometry. So put in those days to get your concepts clear, 
 before you solve questions of a chapter.
3. **Do not panic** if you fail to match the pace of the roadmap. There's no hard and fast learning 
 capacity. Do it in your pace but always try to set a deadline for yourself. But do not just give up
 in between. Work expands with time alloted to it.
4. **Do not rush into online solutions.** There's this thing about RD Sharma that makes it one
 of the top choices for students of class 10. It has problems which highly enhance your problem
 solving capacity and increase conceptual clarity. So, its natural for some problems to look 
 complicated. However, do not rush into searching up online solutions some seconds after
 encountering a hard problem. Rather, spend 4-5 attempts into it, or maybe take a short break, 
 drink water, refreshen yourself and reattempt. Searching up solutions should always be a final
 resort. And remember, after you search up a solution, try to reattempt the problem after a few 
 days, in order to confirm you understood it, or atleast, recall how to do it.
5. **Build Formulae Sheets.** We will encounter a lot of chapters in our syllabus which will be
 reliant on a bunch of different formulae. Infact, the chapters of mensuration and statistics 
 will almost completely be built off formulae. Make and keep a sheet of formulas handy with you.
 This would help you in the long term. As I mentioned before, this roadmap will help you gain 
 strong conceptual clarity and familiarity, practicing on high quality problems. So the next 
 time you encounter a grade 10 mathematics problem, you do not get intimidated. Building such 
 formulae sheets help in quick and glance revisions of concepts.
6. **Mark Important Problems.** Just as you encounter a hard problem, mark it in your reference. 
 This step is very important. This helps you to revisit the quality problems later and thus build
 familiarity by repetition, alongside contributing to your problem solving skills.

## Overview of the book

I have a relatively older edition of RD Sharma, the one before CBSE syllabus got rationalized.
So my index is a bit different, but I'd try to exclude out the changes. I would also recommend
you to get your hands on an older edition if you haven't purchased your book yet. It often has 
more quality problems.

The order of chapters that are present in the book are:
1. Real Numbers
2. Polynomials
3. Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables
4. Quadratic Equations
5. Arithmetic Progressions
6. Co-ordinate Geometry
7. Triangles
8. Circles
9. Trigonometric Ratios
10. Trigonometric Identities
11. Heights and Distances
12. Areas Related To Circles
13. Surface Area and Volumes
15. Statistics
16. Probability

When I started the challenge for myself, I was pretty much clear with the concepts of 
polynomials, linear equations in 2 variables and trigonometry. Rest of them were pretty
untouched. However, I will be including in time in the roadmap to complete these concepts. 
However, trigonometry is something you might need to spend some time on, so better have it
as a prerequisite.

## The Roadmap

Finally, the roadmap/routine/schedule or whatever you might call it, goes as such:

### Day 1

The first day of the challenge is gonna be heavy, as that is when you have the most motivation
whenever taking up a challenge. Start with the first chapter. The first problem you might face 
in the first chapter is it's complicated language. It presents information you already knew 
since younger classes, in a more formal manner. Read the theory first, and if it still
feels complicated, refer to some videos. Understand **Euclid's Division Lemma** properly. 
Remember what Remark 1 of the chapter says:

> The lemma is nothing but a restatement of the long division process we have been doing since 
years

After the lemma, practice the examples that follow, as such questions are usually the ones which
get people stuck. Finish off Exercise 1.1. Exercise 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 should be easy. 
Finish them off. Then you'll encounter proving of irrationality. Do the concepts very well. It's 
an important section. Look at few examples. Then attempt all problems of Exercise 1.5.

First chapter done. I had spent a lot of time on this chapter, especially in the Lemma.

Now begin polynomials, again a very conceptual chapter but we already have a good background of
it from 9th grade. Understand graphs of linear and quadratic equations very well. If possible,
while reading the theory, note the important remarks down. Always handy for quick revisions.
The graphs of quadratic equations do not have any Exercise Questions, so practice the examples
given. This part becomes important in one markers. Learn the relations between coefficients 
properly. My book also had relations of cubic coefficients. This chapter has just one exercise, 
with very quality problems. So, do them all.

Second Chapter done.

Now comes Linear Equations in Two Variables. It's a tedious chapter. Do the 
concepts well, the methods to solve such equations. Also read Conditions for Solvability, 
important for one markers. Atleast complete till Exercise 3.3 by Day 1. Understand cross
multiplication method well, even though it involves more of learning up than remembering.

Day ends, you have completed 2 and a half chapters, but hold up, Day 2 is gonna be some... Pain.

### Day 2

Today's a tedious day, but I'll simplify it down for you. There are a ton of exercises in Chapter
3 and 4, hence, do them. The concepts are almost uniform in all of them. They are just of different
types. Some being related to work, some to speed-time-distance while some age related. You could 
attempt alternate problems (do not, in LOTS and HOTS). 

After finishing off Chapter 3, we move on to the next chapter, Quadratic Equations. Again, there's
not much new concepts, but a ton of exercises. I did not do them completely. I did all problems till
Exercise 4.5, then started alternating. I skipped the ones picked up from NCERT, because I had 
already solved them once. In fact, on attending school, you'll have to do the NCERT problems along
with the flow anyway. So you could skip them.

I moved on to Arithmetic Progressions. Again, built my conceptual layer on this first. Then, 
Exercises 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 were a breeze. In fact, I actually finished them verbally on a morning walk. But then came
Exercise 5.4 was long but easy. 

## Day 3

Finish up 5.4 and 5.5 early in the day. Exercise 5.6 was an absolute nightmare, 46 questions, often'
repetitive. Again, started alternating. So I just did about 30 of the problems. Again, try to alternate
less on LOTS.

Then came in Coordinate Geometry. This chapter was fun for me. I sat with it for a long time and finished
the whole chapter at once. This was when I looked back at my progress, I had already finished 6 out of 15 
chapters, from **the** R.D. Sharma itself. Felt like an absolute confidence booster. And yes, I had 
not done much in the first three days except mathematics. Setting rigorous deadlines often help you do 
a ton at little time. (I mean, if we studied throughout the year how we study a day before exams, 
CBSE averages would've been 99%)

I had already started up on triangles. But this chapter is concept heavy. All the new concepts of 
similarity. I usually do not opt for long lectures for mathematics, but this was a chapter I just
HAD to refer to them, due to the concepts. I had done some concepts and dozed off.

### Day 4

After brushing atop the concepts, the questions went pretty easy. Some of them were 
difficult, and high quality. All in all, this chapter had it's spikes and downs, but you'll do it 
with some persistence. I wouldn't recommend alternating on this one. Similarity is a principle
which is used highly in mathematics. So, the better you grasp on it, the more advantages you will retain.

Now come Circles. Another chapter similar to that of class 9, carrying the same trauma from 
class 9. A hundred new properties and theorems to set into memory, and prove. Torture of a chapter
as you flip through the theory, but you'll enjoy the problems. This chapter has some actual high
quality problems to keep you hooked.

Do this for the day 4, even though the chapter has just 2 exercises, problem count and complexity
is high. 

### Day 5

Let's check upon our progress. Damn, you're telling me we completed 8 chapters in 5 days? What's next?
Our big big encounter, trigonometry. I was already familiar with trigonometrical concepts so I finished this portion 
very quick. But donate the whole day to trigonometrical concepts. It is new, some things need to 
be memorized. But once you've got the general grasp at them, they will become the most enjoyable chapters
of the book. Trigonometric Ratios should be easy once you're done with the basics. Now comes 
Trigonometric Identities, the best chapter in the syllabus in my opinion. 

Do this whole heartedly, try to look at online solutions as rarely as possible. Just play with the
equations, do things, play with the identities. Enjoy this chapter to the fullest, it's an absolute
roller coaster. In fact, if you're done with the chapter before the day ends and still have sparable
time, give that time to solving it's examples

## Day 6

Next comes another tedious chapter, heights and distances. Now this is the time when you use the 
trigonometric table. That is, the standard angles. Now this becomes really easy if we try to 
follow a simple trick. We take numbers 0,1,2,3,4 for the angles 0, 30, 45, 60 and 90 respectively.
Then we divide these numbers by 4, such that 0/4, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4 represent the angles.
The square roots of these numbers will give us the respective values for sines of angle 0, 30, 45,
60 and 90.

Hence, 
- sin 0 deg = 0
- sin 30 deg = 1/2
- sin 45 deg = 1/(root 2)
- sin 60 deg = (root 3)/2
- sin 90 deg = 1

The cosines are nothing but inversions of the order.

- cos 90 deg = 0
- cos 60 deg = 1/2
- cos 45 deg = 1/(root 2)
- cos 30 deg = (root 3)/2
- cos 0 deg = 1

The tangent values could be found by dividing sines by cosines.

- tan 0 deg = 0
- tan 30 deg = 1/(root 3)
- tan 45 deg = 1
- tan 60 deg = (root 3)
- tan 90 deg = undefined

Hence, the cosecant, secant and cotangent can be found out by inversing these values. 

Now for this chapter, do not skip any questions. The repetition in questions would help you to 
engrave this table in your mind. By the time you reach the end of the chapter, the table, especially
the tangent values, will be set completely in your mind. With this, you will be completing
10th grade trigonometry. 

### Day 7

3 chapters done, 4 chapters left. 4 days left. Seems like a lot of time at hand, considering we 
completed so many chapters in 6 days, we have a lot of time right? This is what I thought, so I 
slacked off at this point. I casually opened the next chapter, Areas Related to Circles, and I 
was throwed at with another set of concepts, and a new bunch of formulas. However, as I was on
a challenge, I grabbed up a calculator for my calculations. These mensuration related chapters
essentially rely less on concepts and more around formulas. So the repetition of problems is just
to make sure the formula gets fitted into your head. Again, memorization by repetition. 

The calculator boosted my calculative speed. However, this part is why I didn't recommend people 
to do this challenge before exams. Using a calculator to apply a formula we derived on paper gives
the solution in seconds, but in the exam hall we do not have calculators. We have to eventually
do them by ourselves. So using calculators to solve problems from this book before a critical 
checkpoint could be risky. But for the sake of concepts, and maintaining a pace, some liberty is 
acceptable, especially for mensuration. Do not alternate here, save it for the next chapter. ;D 

### Day 8

Surface Area and Volumes, I already knew how torturous and tedious this chapter would have been, 
and after doing the tedious chapters of quadratics, AP, heights and distances, areas related to 
circles in a row, I was really not willing to do these anymore. I picked up a formula sheet from 
the net, didnt even look at the theory and started doing questions. I took up huge liberties here, 
alternated around questions, used a calculator. Basically sped around the chapter as fast as I 
could. However the problem count was lesser than I expected, it was sheerly the momentum that made
me rush through this chapter. I even skipped a lot of problems. 

And after this, I was officially exhausted. But I had just two chapters left to syllabus, only 
statistics. How hard would that be?

Opened the next chapter, started reading the theory, instantly regretted my thoughts. 

### Day 9

Again, sitting back on Statistics, a whole bunch of algorithms were thrown at me, leaving me
absolutely frustrated. Every exercise felt more tedious than other. I only did a few problems 
from here, as almost each and every one of them required me to draw tables and graphs. I almost
skipped the whole chapter. I just did three or four questions from the main concepts, and some LOTS.

Then I studied other subjects the whole day. Statistics had seemed to drain me out. But it was the
second last chapter, so I had enough time to revisit it later. In fact, the problems I skipped through
alternation could be easily done in my spare time. Say, while travelling to school, in public transport.
All those times when we spend scrolling at our phones, we could alternate that with these quick
handy questions. As we already know the concepts and formulae, we could solve them as hobbyist 
problems. As for Statistics, I'd recommend you to explore better representations and get your concepts
crystal clear. In Day 9, I did not really give much effort to this chapter. I feel this is a chapter
I should have got a better hold of, but as it was Day 9 and the second last 
chapter, I felt less committed to work. If you're not in a condition like me, where you do this 
challenge early in the year, try to avoid taking so many liberties. 

### Day 10

Final day, final chapter, final exercise infact. The concepts are pretty fundamental, which we
learnt back in 7th grade. 37 problems but these are relatively easier and could be done swiftly. 
And once you finish the last exercise, you will have completed the whole R.D. Sharma, in 
just 10 days. Yes, the complete book. Do not worry about the problems you alternated on/skipped on
your way. You already know the concepts, so they could pretty much be picked up over time.

### What it felt like?

It was indeed a roller coaster of a journey. It was fun, productive and confidence-boosting 
while also being tiring, tedious, and torturous at times. All in all, you need to put in a 
lot of willpower and continued motivation to accomplish it. It might not be possible in 10
continuous days, as some chapters will trigger the procrastination in us (this was Statistics
and Surface Areas for me). But try to not exceed 15-18 days.That's approximately half of a 
month. 

During the beginning of the challenge, I was doing only mathematics for the whole day. This went on 
for few days, and by the time I did Arithmetic Progressions, mathematics somewhat turned into a habit. I was
the basic problems during morning walks, carrying a little pocket notebook with me wherever I went.
Public transport, journeys, those hours of scrolling, had all been integrated with mathematics.
It was the period where I had picked up the most pace. Then as the chapters got more and more 
tedious, the work ethic kinda drifted away. 

Again, as mentioned before, **this roadmap will provide you the conceptual clarity, and familiarity
with high quality problems**. Not much comes out of solving a problem just once. Repetition and 
revision is the key. So what you'll eventually have in hand after 10 days is actually nothing but 
experience in doing the problems. It is a good starting point, and with proper revision, it can help
you recieve excellent results in the subject. 

The roadmap is harsh, and most of you would probably not have the time to finish the challenge, but
I feel these deadlines just help one work more. And moreover, we spend so much time doing 
unproductive things today, slipping in an hour or two of mathematics in between shouldn't be a 
problem. If you go to school, utilize those recess times and the free time you get. Slip in one or two 
problems within your school time. You would not have time till you make it.

Best of luck...
